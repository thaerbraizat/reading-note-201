When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

**HTML** Uses Elementsto Describe the Structure of Pages,To learn **HTML** you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

**DOCTYPES** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using,The id and class attributes allow you to identify 
particular elements,The *div* tag and *span* tag elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

The new **HTML5** elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure,older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return, **wireframes** allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.

**A script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the *JavaScript* will not have changed the *HTML*, 
because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file,
JavaScript files are text files,but they have the *js* extension.
